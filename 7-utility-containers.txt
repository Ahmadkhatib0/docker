# if we have a command after (ie docker run .... npm init), it'll override the CMD 
# inside the Dockerfile, but with ie ENTRYPOINT ["npm"] , it will first restrict the commands
# that you can to run with this container for just npm + .... , for example you'll not be allowed 
# to execute node + ..... , and second it will prefix (npm ) to your specified commands 
# when running containers based on this Dockerfile (ie npm install => just install )
